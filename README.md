# Setup pisstaube

the easiest way would be docker i guess, simply run those commands (!WARNING! DO NOT RUN UNTRUSTED COMMANDS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO!):
```console
:~$ git clone https://github.com/Pisstaube/pisstaube.git
:~$ cd pisstaube
:~$ cp docker.env.example docker.env # PLEASE EDIT YOUR docker.env! as it's our config file
:~$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

i do not recommend setting it up though,
as we don't want to make peppy mad by using too much of his valuable bandwidth.

That's why i've setup my own mirror at [pisstau.be](https://pisstau.be) where it basically stores EVERY SINGLE BEATMAP that has been downloaded at least once.
